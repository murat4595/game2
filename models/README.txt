Put your .glb or .gltf files in this folder.
Expected filenames:
- ayse.glb (for Ayşe character)
- fatma.glb (for Fatma character)
- mehmet.glb (for Mehmet character)
- building_school.glb (for School)
- building_house.glb (for House)
- building_library.glb (for Library)

The game will automatically load these files if they exist. If not, it will show the default shapes.
